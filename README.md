# My MLB The Show Pocket

Welcome to My MLB The Show Pocket application. This application enables MLB The Show players to search for MLB Player Cards that are currently in the marketplace. It also provides a Squad Builder tool where you can search, save, and add players to your squad. This tool enables you to methodically decide what your squad can look like outside of the game's platform.

This application uses Sony Studio's MLB The Show API.

This application is also in its beta stage so you may experience some weird UX behaviors and bugs.
